## ✨ Verified Features

### 🧠 Vector-Only Trading Brain (Pure Vector Database)
- **ChromaDB Vector Store**: All trade statistics computed on-demand from rich metadata stored in the vector database—no JSON files needed.
- **Semantic Trade Retrieval**: Past trades are retrieved based on *semantic similarity* to current market conditions (Trend, ADX, Volatility, RSI, MACD, Volume, Bollinger Bands, Weekend/Weekday, Fear & Greed Sentiment, Order Book Pressure).
- **Key Insights Flow**: Each trade stores the high-level reasoning generated by the AI at entry. When a trade closes, the system automatically retrieves the original entry reasoning to store it as a "Key Insight" in the vector memory, ensuring historical consistency even if intermediate updates occurred.
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: The system continuously learns optimal thresholds (ADX, R/R, confidence) from historical vector data without manual tuning.
- **Performance Bucketing**: Granular analysis of performance by ADX levels (LOW/MED/HIGH) and confluence factors (Trend Alignment, Momentum, Volume Support).
- **Real-Time Aggregation**: Statistics (confidence calibration, ADX performance, confluence factors) are computed directly from the vector store when needed, with smart caching.
- **Rich Per-Trade Metadata**: Each trade stores 15+ fields including RSI, ADX, ATR, SL/TP distances, R/R ratio, MAE/MFE, and confluence factor scores.
- **Context-Aware AI**: The AI sees: *"In similar conditions (High ADX + Bullish), we won 80% of trades with avg P&L +4.2%"* derived from semantic vector search.

### 🕐 Adaptive Memory System
- **Temporal Awareness**: Every trade stores `timestamp` and `market_regime` metadata, enabling time-windowed queries like "What worked in the last Bull Run?"
- **Decay Engine**: Recency-weighted retrieval using exponential decay (90-day half-life). Recent trades are prioritized over ancient history.
- **Hybrid Scoring**: Results ranked by `similarity * 0.7 + recency * 0.3` for optimal context relevance.
- **Automated Reflection Loop**: Every 10 trades, the brain automatically synthesizes patterns from recent wins/losses into persistent **Semantic Rules**.
  - **Positive Rules**: Generated when at least 5 wins follow a consistent regime/ADX pattern.
  - **Anti-Patterns**: Generated when at least 3 losses share a similar trait, flagging them as "⚠️ AVOID" patterns for future analysis.
- **Self-Learning Rules**: Semantic rules are stored persistently in a dedicated ChromaDB collection and injected into AI prompts to enforce learned behavior (e.g., "MANDATORY: If win rate <50%, reduce confidence").

### 🤖 AI & LLM Support
- **Multi-Provider Support**: 
  - **Google Gemini**: Configurable model selection. Optimized for `gemini-3-flash-preview` (Temp 1.0, TopK 64) via `config.ini`.
  - **Claude 4.5 / Google Gemini 3 Pro**: Support for state-of-the-art reasoning models via OpenRouter.
  - **BlockRun.AI**: Pay-per-request access to 28+ AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) via x402 micropayments on Base blockchain. No subscriptions needed.
  - **LM Studio**: Local LLM support verified via `lm_studio_base_url`.
- **Fallback Logic**: Automatically switches providers if primary fails (Google AI -> OpenRouter -> BlockRun -> Local).
- **Vision-Assisted Trading**: Generates technical charts with indicators and sends them to vision-capable models (e.g., Gemini Flash) for visual pattern confirmation.

### 📢 RAG Engine (News & Context)
- **News Aggregator**: Requires a **CryptoCompare API Key**. The free tier typically offers ~150k lifetime requests, which is sufficient for continuous bot operation.
- **Smart Relevance Scoring**: Uses **keyword density**, **category matching**, and **coin-specific heuristics** to filter noise and prioritize data-rich content.
- **Lead Paragraph Extraction**: Extracts coherent lead paragraphs from articles following the "Inverted Pyramid" structure, preserving narrative flow and context.
- **Configurable Limits**: Adjustable token limits and article counts to manage context window.

### 🌍 Market Data & Exchanges
- **Multi-Exchange Aggregation**: Fetches data via `ccxt` from **5+ exchanges**:
  - Binance, KuCoin, Gate.io, MEXC, Hyperliquid
- **Comprehensive Data**:
  - OHLCV Candles (1m to 1w)
  - Order Book Depth & Spread Analysis
  - Recent Trade Flow (Buyer/Seller Pressure)
  - Funding Rates (for Perpetual Futures)

### 🔒 Application Safeguards
- **Cross-Platform Single-Instance Locking**: Prevents multiple instances from running concurrently, protecting against API rate limit bans and state corruption.
- **Graceful Shutdown Management**: Dedicated manager handles SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and SIGTERM, ensuring all trade data is persisted before exit.
- **Safety Confirmation**: Optional GUI confirmation (via PyQt6) or console prompts when attempting to shut down.

### 📈 Trading Intelligence
- **Realistic Capital Tracking**: Dynamic compounding of trading capital based on realized P&L. No static initial capital assumptions.
- **Advanced Performance Metrics**: Real-time calculation of **Sharpe Ratio**, **Sortino Ratio**, **Max Drawdown**, and **Profit Factor**.
- **Currency-Agnostic P&L**: Tracks profits and losses accurately in the relevant quote currency (e.g., USDT, ETH, BTC).
- **Vision-Assisted Trading**: Generates technical charts with indicators and sends them to vision-capable models (e.g., Gemini Flash) for visual pattern confirmation.
- **Weekend Awareness**: Automatic detection of weekend trading with explicit warnings about lower volume/liquidity and manipulation risks.

### 🖥️ Real-Time Web Dashboard
- **Brain Visualization**: Interactive network graph showing trade sequences (BUY → UPDATE → CLOSE) using Vis.js with physics-based layout and automatic stabilization.
- **Performance Chart**: Equity curve with zoom/pan controls, trade markers (BUY/CLOSE annotations), and ApexCharts integration.
- **Live Statistics**: Real-time stats display (Win Rate, P&L%, Capital, Trades) pulled from trading history.
- **Vector Memory Database**: Full ChromaDB visualization with **sortable columns** (Date, Similarity, P&L, Confidence, Outcome), experience table, and win rate breakdowns.
- **Thought Stream**: View last AI prompt and response with markdown rendering and copy-to-clipboard.
- **Visual Cortex**: Displays generated technical charts with lightbox for full-screen viewing.
- **Neural State Panel**: Shows current trend sentiment, confidence level, and recommended action.
- **Position Details**: Real-time position monitoring with entry price, duration, P&L gauges, and confluence factors.
- **Interactive Panel System**:
  - **Fullscreen Mode**: Expand any panel to fullscreen with proper chart/network resizing.
  - **Collapsible Panels**: Minimize panels to save screen space with responsive sibling expansion.
  - **WebSocket Real-Time Updates**: Live connection status indicator and auto-reconnection.
